# Prolopsi
Prolipsi is a medical web application designed to help users reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This web application will help users decide whether to see a doctor or not based on an x-ray scan and symptoms they are experiencing. Based on a database of x-ray images of COVID positive lungs and normal lungs, the program uses a neural network to analyze and predict if the uploaded image of the user's lung is COVID positive.
